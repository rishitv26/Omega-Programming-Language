# Omega Programming Language

The Omega Programming Language (Omega) is a language that is a child of C++. What do I mean? Omega was specifically created to simplify 
C++, and retain its key features like speed and efficiency. Omega also aims to add an extra layer of abstraction without reducing 
performance significantly, where things like strings can be a primary datatype. We also aim for compatibility with other languages, like 
custom compilation, and library usage from other languages.

Please note that this is a project by some low life middle schooler (now a highschool freshman), so please take these claims with a grain 
of salt.

## Syntax

The syntax of Omega is going to be a blend of many major languages, and maybe something new. All syntax specific info is listed below. 
Please note that not everything has been fully implemented, so this is more like a "things to be added" list.

### Variables

Every basic program must have some variable manipulation going on. Here is how you can do that in Omega:

```
int Variable : 8 ;comments are semicolons.
string str : "Strings are only double quotes"
; note that line terminating semicolons are not required.

str : "I am modifying the variable value"
int NewVar : Variable - 89 ;assignment to expressions.


```
